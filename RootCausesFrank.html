            <ul>
              <li>
                Lack of resources (i.e. finances or local supermarkets) leads low-income families to eat fast food which leads them  to having a higher chance of poor health/health issues. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Low income communities/minority communities (like the ones in Philadelphia) coming together to create community gardens where healthy fruits/vegetables are grown and accessible to their communities.

              “Black and low-income neighborhoods tend to have higher concentrations of fast-food restaurants and low produce supply stores. Limited access to and consumption of nutrient-rich foods is associated with poor health outcomes.”
            </div>
            <div class="col text-primary  border-primary border border-3">
              Black and low income communities don't have the same access to big chain supermarkets like the middle class or white families. Without this access they have to result in cheap fast food options. Continuously eating these fast foods leads to health issues.

            <div class="col text-primary  border-primary border border-3">
              Due to not having the same access to these same stores, the Black communities in Philadelphia have started their own community garden so their residents have access to healthy food/ingredients.
