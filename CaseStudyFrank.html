        A lot of low-income community members shop at local liquor stores because that is one of the main accesses of “grocery shopping”.  It's either too expensive to go to big chain stores or they lack financial resources to shop at one.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col text-black fw-bold  border-dark border border-3">
        The most effective way to address issues of food insecurity is to advocate and educate for healthy food options for everyone.
      </div>
      <div class="col text-white  border-dark border border-3">
        Writing to local district representatives to talk about the ongoing and largely growing problem of food insecurity in low income communities is one way to advocate for better resources.
        <p></p>
        One way to educate people is to gather people within your community for an “info session” on food insecurity and the lack of access to food within the community and come up with ways to solve this issue.

  <h1 class="text-center">Use of Technology</h1>
  <div class="container text-center">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col text-black fw-bold  border-dark border border-3">
        Technology can be used to spread awareness on food insecurity and help connect community members together to come up with an issue to solve this problem.
      </div>
      <div class="col text-white  border-dark border border-3">
        Social media is a great place to make info posts or slides to spread awareness on problems going on within your own community or community you know of. Since social media is largely used it can help spread and inform people who don't know what's going on. 
        <p></p>
        Also within community groups on social media and websites there can be comments or discussion posts that engage members all around the community to come up with ways to help advocate or solve this problem of food insecurity.

        For my website I could team up with an organization that specializes in food insecurity.
      </div>
      <div class="col text-white  border-dark border border-3">
        I can team up with an organization that advocates, educates, and fights for low income communities to have the same right to food accessibility. This can help me provide data and also give me a list of resources that I can list on my actual website.
