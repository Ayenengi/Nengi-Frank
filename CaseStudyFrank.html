                    The positive impact of this organization is that they address the growing issue of food insecurity in low income communities and allow the youth that live in these communities to come up with ways and carry out projects that will benefit their community. 
                    <p></p>
                    They focus on health equality in food systems, in the Oakland neighborhood by playing a critical role in city planning, and community and youth engagement by allowing youth voices to be heard.

                Not enough funding to keep the youth program alive. Unexpected staff change that allows the program to be short staffed.
                <p></p>
                Technology can be used to improve this by calling for more funding through social media or their website.
