      <h6 >According to The USDA, a food desert is “a place where at least a third of the population lives greater than one mile away from a supermarket for urban areas, or greater than 10 miles for rural areas.” Which means that “about 19 million people in America live in a food desert.” The article points out how this issue is primarily affecting Black neighborhoods due to the lack of grocery stores in Black communities. This issue has been pointed out since Michelle Obamas “Let’s Move” campaign in 2010 and the issue is still persistent.</h6> <p class="text-dark">Source:<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/20/trader-joes-kroger-walmart-supervalu-and-americas-food-deserts.html">CNBC</a> Bias=Left-Center Fact reporting=Mostly-Factual</p>

      <h6>Tanesha White, wrote an article for Healthline about a food justice program in New York. Shari Rose is a  “New York-based City Parks Foundation’s associate director of environmental education” and said that food justice to her is “creating a world where everyone has access to healthy and culturally relevant food.” This article reported that Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ communities in New York were primarily affected by food aparthied. The rising cost of food is one of the leading factors affecting low-income communities. The article also states how the access to food has always been low for these communities but with inflation it has made it harder for these communities to access food.</h6> <p class="text-dark">Source:<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-food-justice">Healthline</a> Bias=Pro-Science Fact reporting=Mostly-Factual</p>

      <h6>ABC10 reported that Dunnigan, CA, a population of 1400,  only has one grocery store in town. The store said that, “they had a limited number of produce available…” but when ABC10 went to the grocery store no fresh produce was to be seen. This may lead to a lot of families in towns like this to shop at fast food or liquor stores to acquire their food. The Yolo food bank in this area helps out with food distribution to low-income families. Maria Segoviano said that, “...populations that are more susceptible to food insecurity because they are in rural areas and not connected to services.” The Yolo food bank helps low-income rural areas in their county receive the healthy food they deserve.</h6> <p class="text-dark">Source:<a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/families-food-distributions-food-desert-communities/103-42b7c669-3c6e-4967-98af-a2e322ea1d6d">Abc10</a> Bias=Left-Center Fact reporting=Highly-Factual</p>
